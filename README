So the theme of the jam was "Exploration"… The idea I had was to move around a sort of map killing lots of creators that would explode into different kinds of loot when I killed them. Then id use that loot to purchase new weapons and other stuff to further pass other obstacles in the map so I could explore more and find even more rare loot!

Being a huge fan of loot based games, I was really hyped to do this… But then things just didn't work out as I had planned so I did a pivot mid way and completely changed the idea after I couldn't get the shooting mechanic to fire multiple directions… So I shifted it to a weird pokemon game where you have to only fire to the right at the incoming pickachu's and shoot them with poke balls. That is far as I got because Jam ended.

The controls for the game are pretty simple, push up, down, left, or right arrow keys to move bulbasaur(he is really slippery!) and push spacebar to fire right! Just aim for the pickachu's, the more you kill the more your score goes up! That's it... Never ending fun for all the kids :-P


The music was pulled from newgrounds.com and the images were pulled from google images, I not own any of the assets… Just the code :-) Used Flixel a AS3 game library to help speed the process up.

The tool I used was Flash Builder 4.6.
